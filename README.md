This project is a Flask-based web application that extracts text from PDF files. It determines whether the PDF contains selectable text or is a scanned document, using  for direct text extraction and  for scanned images.

## Features

- Extracts text from PDFs with selectable text using
- Detects scanned PDFs and applies OCR with
- Automatic Tesseract installation check and language data download
- Returns extracted text in a structured JSON format
- Provides processing time and extraction method details

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ``` sh
   git clone https://github.com/kjanat/pdf-extract-with-ocr.git
   cd pdf-extract-with-ocr
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ``` sh
   python -m venv venv

   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate

   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ``` sh
   pip install -U -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install Tesseract OCR:

   - On Windows, use winget:

     ``` powershell
     'tesseract-ocr.tesseract', 'SQLite.SQLite' | 
         % { winget install --id=$_ }
     ```

   - On macOS, use Homebrew:

     ``` sh
     brew install \
         tesseract \
         redis \
         sqlite
     ```

   - On Linux, use your package manager:

     ``` sh
     sudo apt-get install -y \
         tesseract-ocr \
         redis-server \
         sqlite3
     ```

## Usage

1. Run the Flask application:

   ``` sh
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the web interface and upload a pdf, or upload a PDF file through the `/upload` endpoint:

   ``` sh
   curl -X POST -F file=@path/to/your/file.pdf http://127.0.0.1:5000/upload
   ```

3. The API will return a JSON response with the extracted text, status, method used, and processing duration.

## Docker Usage

### Using Docker Compose

The easiest way to run the full stack is with Docker Compose:

1. Download the  file:

   ``` sh
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjanat/pdf-extract-with-ocr/docker/docker-compose.yml
   ```

2. Adjust the `docker-compose.yml` file if necessary. You can change the ports or other configurations as needed.

   ``` yaml
   services:
     api:
       image: kjanat/pdf-extract-with-ocr:latest
       ports:
         - "8080:80"
       environment:
         - IS_DOCKER_CONTAINER=true
         - CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
         - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://ocruser:ocrpass@db:5432/ocr
     worker:
       image: kjanat/pdf-extract-with-ocr:latest
       command: celery -A main.celery worker --loglevel=info
     redis:
       image: redis:latest
     db:
       image: postgres:latest
       environment:
         POSTGRES_USER: user
         POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
         POSTGRES_DB: pdf_extract_db
   ```

3. Start the services:

   ``` sh
   docker-compose up
   ```

This starts four services:

- The Flask API server on port `8080`
- A Celery worker for processing PDFs
- A Redis instance for the message queue
- A PostgreSQL database for storing results

### Running the Docker Image Directly

You can also run just the API container:

```sh
docker run -p 8080:80 -e IS_DOCKER_CONTAINER=true kjanat/pdf-extract-with-ocr:latest-full
```

### Supported Architectures

The Docker images are built for multiple architectures:

- linux/amd64 (x86_64)
- linux/arm64 (aarch64)
- linux/arm/v7 (armv7)

Docker will automatically pull the correct image for your system architecture.

## Example Response

``` json
{
   "body": "Extracted text from the PDF here...",
   "status": "success",
   "method": "tesseract",
   "filename": "example.pdf",
   "datetime": "2025-03-21T12:34:56.789012+00:00",
   "duration (ms)": 12.3
}
```
