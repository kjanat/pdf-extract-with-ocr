# PDF Extract with OCR

This project is a Flask-based web application that extracts text from PDF files. It determines whether the PDF contains selectable text or is a scanned document, using `pymupdf` for direct text extraction and `Tesseract OCR` for scanned images.

## Features

- Extracts text from PDFs with selectable text using `pymupdf`
- Detects scanned PDFs and applies OCR with `Tesseract`
- Automatic Tesseract installation check and language data download
- Returns extracted text in a structured JSON format
- Provides processing time and extraction method details

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/kjanat/pdf-extract-with-ocr.git
    cd pdf-extract-with-ocr
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate

    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip install -U -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Install Tesseract OCR:
    - On Windows, use winget:

        ```powershell
        winget install --id=tesseract-ocr.tesseract
        ```

    - On macOS, use Homebrew:

        ```sh
        brew install tesseract
        ```

    - On Linux, use your package manager:

        ```sh
        sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
        ```

## Usage

1. Run the Flask application:

    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the web interface and upload a pdf, or upload a PDF file through the `/upload` endpoint:

    ```sh
    curl -X POST -F file=@path/to/your/file.pdf http://127.0.0.1:5000/upload
    ```

3. The API will return a JSON response with the extracted text, status, method used, and processing duration.

## Example Response

```json
{
   "body": "Extracted text from the PDF here...",
   "status": "success",
   "method": "tesseract",
   "filename": "example.pdf",
   "datetime": "2025-03-21T12:34:56.789012+00:00",
   "duration (ms)": 12.3
}
```
