A Flask-based web application that intelligently extracts text from PDF files. It automatically determines whether the PDF contains selectable text or is a scanned document, using [PyMuPDF](https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF) for direct text extraction and [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) for scanned images.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Smart Text Extraction** - Automatically detects if a PDF has selectable text or needs OCR
- **Multiple Extraction Methods**:
    - Direct text extraction using PyMuPDF for standard PDFs
    - OCR processing with Tesseract for scanned documents
- **Multiple Deployment Options**:
    - Full stack deployment with Docker Compose (recommended)
    - Local installation
    <!-- - Direct Docker image usage -->
- **Multi-architecture Support** - Docker images built for: `amd64`, `arm64`, and `arm/v7`
- **Web Interface and API Access** - Upload PDFs through a browser

## üì¶ Installation

=== "Docker Compose"
    The recommended way to run the application is with Docker Compose, which sets up all necessary services (Flask, Redis, PostgreSQL) in a single command.

    <div class="annotate" markdown>

    1. Download the [`docker-compose.yml`][docker-compose.yml] file:

        ```bash
        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kjanat/pdf-extract-with-ocr/docker/docker-compose.yml
        ```

    2. Create a `.env` file optional (1):

        ``` hcl title=".env"
        # API configuration
        API_PORT=8080
        UPLOADS_DIR=./uploads

        # Database configuration
        POSTGRES_USER=ocruser
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD=ocrpass
        POSTGRES_DB=ocr
        DATABASE_URL=postgresql://ocruser:ocrpass@db:5432/ocr

        # Celery configuration
        CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
        ```

    3. Start the services:

        ```bash
        docker-compose up -d
        ```

    4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080

=== "Clone and Run Locally"
    If you prefer to run the application locally without Docker, you can clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

    **Prerequisites**

    Depending on your system, you may need to install the following dependencies:

    - Python 3.8 or higher
    - pip
    - Tesseract OCR (for OCR processing)
    - SQLite (for local database storage)

    ??? tip "Install Dependencies"

        === ":fontawesome-brands-linux: Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)"

            ``` sh title="Debian/Ubuntu"
            sudo apt-get install -y \
                tesseract-ocr \
                redis-server \
                sqlite3
            ```
        
        === ":fontawesome-brands-windows: Windows"
        
            ``` powershell title="PowerShell (Launch as Administrator)"
            'tesseract-ocr.tesseract', 'SQLite.SQLite' | 
                % { winget install --id=$_ }
            ```
        
        === ":fontawesome-brands-apple: macOS"

            ``` sh title="Homebrew"
            brew install \
                tesseract \
                redis \
                sqlite
            ```

    To run the application locally, you can clone the repository:

    1. Clone the repository:

        ``` bash
        git clone https://github.com/kjanat/pdf-extract-with-ocr.git
        cd pdf-extract-with-ocr
        ```

    2. Install the required dependencies:

        ``` bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

    3. Start the flask application on port `8080`:

        ``` bash
        FLASK_RUN_PORT=8080 flask run
        ```

    4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080

<!-- === "Direct Docker"

    If you prefer to run the application directly with Docker:

    1. Pull the latest image:

        ```bash
        docker pull kjanat/pdf-extract-with-ocr:api-latest
        ```

    2. Run the container:

        ```bash
        docker run -d -p 8080:8080 kjanat/pdf-extract-with-ocr:api-latest
        ```

    3. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) -->

<!-- === "GitHub Codespaces"

    You can also run the application in GitHub Codespaces:

    1. Click the "Code" button and select "Open with Codespaces".
    2. Once the environment is set up, run the following command:

        ```bash
        docker-compose up -d
        ```

    3. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) -->

2. Drag and drop PDF files or click to select files
3. View extracted text in the browser

### üîó API

Use the API to extract text programmatically:

``` bash title="Upload PDF"
curl -X POST -F file=@path/to/your/file.pdf http://localhost:8080/upload
```
